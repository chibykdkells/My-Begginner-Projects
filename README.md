# My-begginner-projects
This folder contains all the beginner projects I build as a new frontend developer, 
its available to anyone new to coding to help you gain confidence with frontend development.
These projects helped me a lot, it is said that ''there's no shortcut to becoming a good and experienced developer'',
you must put in the hard work "practice, practice and practice".  
So guys, if I can make it so do you. I really hope that these projects will help. see you at the top.
